# Learning how to configure a full-stack application

Based on [Docker Tutorial for Beginners | Dockerize Any App in 2024](https://youtu.be/GFgJkfScVNU?si=pYv7Z3oUWINsF8r3).

## Run the Application

Run the following command in the terminal;

~~~docker
$ docker compose up
~~~

Then in the upper right corner of the terminal to the left of the trash icon click on `Split Terminal` or use the shortcut keys `(Ctrl+Shift+5)`; <br><br>
In the new terminal run the command below;

~~~javascript
$ docker compose watch
~~~
That's it for now.
